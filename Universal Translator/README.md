This assignment will give you practice in Handling Exceptions using File I/O and the Adapter Design Pattern.</br>
You have been tasked with implementing Star Trek's Universal Translator for today's cell phones.</br>
Your assignment is to allow a Trekkie to send a text message in an Earth language and have it received in any one of the implemented Alien languages.</br>
So far, you only are able to translate from Earth languages to Vulcan and Klingon. However, you need to make your design flexible enough to add additional languages.</br>
Since the main purpose of the assignment is File I/O, Exception Handling and the Adapter Pattern, we will not be coding a complete Universal Translator. 
All you will need to be able to do is send messages from Earth cell phones to other Earth cell phones, and from Earth cell phones to the Federation Alien languages mentioned above.</br>
You will also need to create a custom exception for languages that are not supported should they be requested.</br>
